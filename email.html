		<p class="about-intro">I write emails. And I design them, too. Fundraising emails, activation emails, explainers, newsletters and more. I've drafted copy for emails signed by presidents (non-impeached ones), members of Congress, <em>West Wing</em> stars, rabbis and community leaders across the country. <span class="highlighted-text">Scroll down and click around the 'inbox' for some samples.</span></p>

				Let's leave it all on the (Green)field<span class="preview-text">- With 100 days out from the election, supporters were getting a glut of fundraising emails and we were thinking about how to break through. The answer? Puns. Well, not just puns. We created an opt-in email newsletter with seven actions each week -- a combination of fundraising, Mobilize events and voting rights advocacy -- that mixed humor (a welcome change of pace from the doom and gloom of 2020) and quick overviews of key races and issues. A lot of the races ended in heartbreak, but these emails drove tens of thousands of voter contacts and raised hundreds of thousands for critical races. Art by Nathan Wolfson.</span>
			</div>
			<div class="email-message" id="lonRon">
				<input type="checkbox">
				Lon Ron Ron Lon <span class="preview-text">- This fundraiser for Lon Johnson and Russ Feingold was my first email that got a shout out on the NerdyEmail listserv. It was sent before <em>I, Tonya</em> came out. Felt a little guilty after seeing it.</span>
			</div>
			<div class="email-message" id="slotkin">
				<input type="checkbox">
				One of the most qualified challengers we've ever endorsed <span class="preview-text">- Graphic emails proved to be exceptionally effective with J Street's list. Open rates noticeably increased after we made them a regular part of the email program.  </span>
			</div>
			<div class="email-message" id="iranActivation">
				<input type="checkbox">
				We need calls to the Senate from [your state] now.<span class="preview-text">- Like a lot of email programs, we began to notice decreasing action rates as some orgs flooded inboxes with list-building actions or fundraisers disguised as petitions with mo real theory of change. So when legislative priorities required calls/emails to Congress, I began starting the push with an explainer email to show explain the importance of the action.</span>
			</div>
			<div class="email-message" id="whoSupports">
				<input type="checkbox">
				Who wants to save the Iran deal?<span class="preview-text">- Right wing views tend to dominate media discussions, leading progressive activists to feel like they are on the minority on many foreign policy issues, when they are in fact in the majority. This email served to dispel some myths, but also to hearten supporters at the begninning of an important campaign.   </span>
			</div>
			<div class="email-message" id="friedman">
				<input type="checkbox">
				Our most forwarded email ever<span class="preview-text">- This was another visual explainer email, but not intended for our core supporters. Instead, it was a way to recruit -- as the email says -- folks who may have had some disagreements with J Street's policies to form a united front against a truly repugnant nominee. It did become the org's most forwarded email ever and led to a huge number of subscriptions and first-time actions.</span>
			</div>
			<div class="email-message" id="chickens">
				<input type="checkbox">
				Don't count your chickens before they Hatch Act<span class="preview-text">- Another email from the 100 Days, 100 Ways to Win series (see Greenfield above)</span>
			</div>
			<div class="email-message" id="pacEvent">
				<input type="checkbox">
				Join Senators Tammy Baldwin and Sherrod Brown in DC<span class="preview-text">- Political fundraiser invitations are generally pretty drab, centered-text emails that assume recipients already are invested in the races. I tried somethign a little different here.</span>
			</div>
			<div class="email-message" id="zoom">
				<input type="checkbox">
				The Zoom where it happens<span class="preview-text">- And if you really like bad puns, here's one more 100 Days, 100 Ways to Win email.</span>
